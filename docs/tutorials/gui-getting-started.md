# Getting started with Jeka

## Install Intellij Plugin <a name="install"></a>

* Install plugin directly from [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13489-jeka)
or search _jeka_ in Intellij Marketplace.

As this plugin embeds its own version of _Jeka_, that's all we need to install on our machine.

## Hello World ! <a name="helloworld"></a>

The below example showcases how to write tasks executable both from IDE and the  command line. 

* Create a new Jeka project in Intellij : _New_ > _Project ..._ > _Jeka_ 

![plot](images/blank-project-wizard.png)

Leave default (we might change the name) and press _Create_.

!!! Note
    A Jeka structure (folders and files) can be created in an existing project of any type.
    On IntelliJ *project* window-tool : _Select project_ > Click Left > Jeka ... > Scaffold ...


![plot](images/blank-overall.png)

We get a workable Jeka project from which we can :

- execute/debug methods from the IDE using editor gutter buttons or tool-windows explorer.
- navigate to discover available KBeans on this project, and their content.
- create Intellij *run-configuration* from existing methods
- execute methods directly in the terminal *(e.g. `./jekaw hello name=Joe`)*
- create new methods/fields. If they do not appear in the tool-window, use the top menu button to refresh view.

## Import 3rd Party libraries <a name="import"></a>

We can also import 3rd-party libraries to use in our build classes by using the `@JkInjectClasspath`annotation.

Libraries referenced with coordinates will come into classpath along with all their dependencies.

Do not forget to refresh *iml* explicitly when the Jeka classpath has been changed.

!!! Tip
    Use _Ctrl+space_ when editing `@JkInjectClasspath` to get dependency auto-completion.

## Build a Java Project

* Create a new Jeka project in Intellij : _New_ > _Project ..._ > _Jeka_

* Select **java project** template and click _Create_

![plot](images/java-build-code.png)

Now we have a workable Java project. We can :

* Add dependencies using `project.flatFacade().configureXxxDependencies()` in _Build_ class.
* Add dependencies by editing _project-dependencies.txt_ file
* Customize `project` instance in order to fits your need.

After modifying your dependencies, do not forget to refresh Intellij by _Right Click_ > _Jeka Synchronise Iml File_

Our project is ready to code. Invoke `cleanPack` to generate binary, sources, and javadoc jar files.

!!! Tip
    Navigate to the right-side _Jeka Tool Window_ > _Classpath KBeans_ > _project_ to see all available methods.

    Right-click on a method to run/debug it from IDE. 
    It is possible to combine several methods using _Run..._ or _Debug..._

For most standard projects, we may not need a build code, only a simple properties file. To scaffold such a project :

* Create a new Jeka project in Intellij : _New_ > _Project ..._ > _Jeka_

* Select **java project - code.less** template and click _Create_

We get :

![plot](images/java-build-properties.png)

Execute `./jekaw :build_quality` to create a full build and perform Sonarqube analysis + code coverage.

Properties and code can be used in conjunction, a tough build class may override values defined in _local.properties_.


We will find many project examples [here](https://github.com/jerkar/working-examples)

## Build a Springboot Project <a name="springboot"></a>

* Create a new Jeka project in Intellij : _New_ > _Project ..._ > _Jeka_

* Select **springboot project** template and click _Create_

![plot](images/springboot.png)

We now have a project ready to code, and already containing a workable _RestController_ and its test counterpart.

Execute `./jekaw project#pack` to generate the bootable jar.

Execute `./jekaw project#runJar` to run the bootable.jar

!!! Note
    As for _java project_, Springboot projects can be scaffolded with _code.less_ flavor.
